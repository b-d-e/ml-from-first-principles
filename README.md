Implementing Machine Learning algorithms from first principles, without relying on Python libraries.

![Alt](misc/banner.jpeg "A robot learning Linear Algebra, generated by DALLE.")

## üìã To Do

This will incrementally build up functionality for ML algorithms - initially this will be naively and slow. Over time, I hope to iteratively improve, benchmarking against numpy, scikit-learn, etc.

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

To start, this project will look to build up a MLP MNIST classifier from the ground up.
Roughly, these are the steps I expect to follow:
1. simple linear algebra / core numpy equiv ‚úÖ
2. basic densely connected network, represented with weights and biases ‚úÖ
3. Implement common activation functions ‚úÖ
4. forward pass - for single layer, multi-layer, whole network ‚úÖ
5. loss function (start with cross entropy and MSE) ‚úÖ
6. batched losses
7. backpropogation - chain rule to backprop errors, calculating new w&b
8. optimisation algo for gradient descent
9. data loader
10. training loop, combining above
11. evaluation

## üîß Installation

<!-- ```bash
python -m pip install .
``` -->

From source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/b-d-e/ml-from-first-principles
cd ml-from-first-principles
python -m pip install .
```

## Usage
```python
import mlfp
```

## Caveats
_mlfp.linear_algebra is *incredibly* slow compared to numpy, demonstrated below. Obviously, in a production environment, a maths library would never be written in a scripting language like Python. Here, Python was chosen for faster development in a proof-of-concept project._
