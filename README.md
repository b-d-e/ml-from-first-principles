Implementing Machine Learning algorithms from first principles, without relying on Python libraries.

## To Do

This will incrementally build up functionality for ML algorithms - initially this will be naively and slow. Over time, I hope to iteratively improve, benchmarking against numpy, scikit-learn, etc.

### Linear Algebra Fundamentals:
Implement:

- [ ] Vector Operations
    - [ ] Addition & Subtraction
    - [ ] Scalar Multiplication
    - [ ] Vector Multiplication (Dot Product)
- [ ] Generalise to Matrices
    - [ ] Addition & Subtraction
    - [ ] Scalar Multiplication
    - [ ] Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product)
- [ ] Matrix Transposition

_+ unit tests for the above_
